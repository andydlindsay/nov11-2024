# W02D02 - Asynchronous Control Flow

### To Do
* [x] Blocking Code
* [x] Asynchronous Programming
* [x] `setTimeout` and `setInterval`
* [x] File System Functions (`fs`)

### Sync vs Async
* sync code that executes one line at a time (that takes "zero" time)
* async code runs after the sync code is done (takes time) 

```js
const a = 5;
console.log(a);
```

### Rules of Async Code
* async code CANNOT run until ALL sync code is done
* async functions DO NOT have sync return values

### What is Node?
* a javascript intrepreter
* Chrome V8 engine
* wrapped it in C++
* Node modules

### Encoding
* turning characters into numbers to be stored on an OS
* 'a' => 62
* '!' => 180
* unicode format
* UTF-8
